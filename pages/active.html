        <h2>Active Life Section</h2>
        <p>
          Active living is a lifestyle that integrates physical activity into
          everyday routines, such as walking to the store or biking to work.
          Active living is not a formalized exercise program or routine, but
          instead means to incorporate physical activity, which is defined as
          any form of movement, into everyday life. Active living brings
          together urban planners, architects, transportation engineers, public
          health professionals, activists and other professionals to build
          places that encourage active living and physical activity. One example
          includes efforts to build sidewalks, crosswalks, pedestrian crossing
          signals, and other ways for children to walk safely to and from
          school, as seen in the Safe Routes to School program. Recreational
          opportunities (parks, fitness centres etc.) close to the home or
          workplace, walking trails, and bike lanes for transportation also
          contribute to a more active lifestyle. Active living includes any
          physical activity or recreation activity and contributes to a
          healthier lifestyle. Furthermore, active living addresses health
          concerns, such as obesity and chronic disease, by helping people have
          a physically active lifestyle. Communities that support active living
          gain health benefits, economic advantages, and improved quality of
          life.
